# Branching Testing Project   

#### A short page to practice git branching

#### By **Ann Stonely**

## Technologies Used

* Html
* CSS

## Description

This is a very empty page with almost no content. I used it to learn git branches and keep it around to use it when I learn something else.

## Setup /Installation Requirements

* This page will need to be cloned from https://github.com/AnnStonely/branching-testing-project once you have it on your desktop you can open the branching-website file in your browser.

## Known Bugs

* Just getting started so a lack of content is the only thing to worry about here.
